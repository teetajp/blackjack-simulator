## **Project:**
I want to make a blackjack simulator that can be played on the command line interface or on a graphical user interface (GUI). I also want to make a side user interface that will show the optimal strategy for the player.

#### **Motivation:**
I have played blackjack several times before and understand its basic rules. I also have experience working with a CLI for a game (Amazing Adventures).
I want to better learn how to play and possibly show others how to play.

#### **Rough Timeline:**
(Completed)

By the end of Week 1, I will have created the game engine and the basic CLI and will start working on the GUI.

(Completed)

By the end of Week 2, I will have implemented most of my GUI to make it functional for the user to play the game, and start polishing up the aesthetics of the GUI.

(Completed)

By the end of Week 3, I will have finished polishing up the GUI and make a side user interface to show the optimal strategy.

#### **Stretch Goals:**
If I finish the project early, I could make a display of some statistics on the screen of winning or going bust.
